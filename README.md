 LangGraph Learning & Practical Implementation
This repository is a dedicated workspace for mastering LangGraphâ€”a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-agent, and reactive workflows on top of LangChain. It includes theory, practical implementations, and mini-projects.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives
Understand the core concepts of LangGraph (StateGraph, nodes, edges, workflows).

Learn how to design multi-step computation graphs using LangChain tools.

Implement practical examples such as calculators, decision trees, agent workflows, and data pipelines.

Integrate with LLMs, memory modules, and external tools.
